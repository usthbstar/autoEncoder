There are many 1D CNN auto-encoders examples, they can be reconfigurable in both input and output according to your compression needs  

Example of CNN Auto-encoder_example01 is attached



**The Original (cover speech) and the output (stego speech after using SIAE) Databases are available in [KAGGLE](https://www.kaggle.com/hamzakheddar/SIAE-DB-Speech)**

Please cite the following paper if you find the database usefull in your new steganalysis or steganography research, or if you quote some parts of the research paper that fit your research you conduct.
