After applying out proposed steganographic method (SIAE scheme). we have two speech databases:

1) Original database coded by G723.1 coder (cover speech).
2) The output database after pplying our SIAE scheme over G723.1 (stego speech.)

These two databases are very important to test a built Steganalysis schemes that suppose to uncover the SIAE method.
